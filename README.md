# PredictionUsing-Supervised-learning
Project Description
Overview
This project aims to predict the percentage score of students based on the number of study hours using a simple linear regression model. The dataset provided includes the number of study hours and the corresponding percentage scores of students.

Objective
The objective of this project is to create a linear regression model that can predict a student's percentage score based on the number of hours they study. This can help in understanding the relationship between study time and academic performance.

Steps
Data Collection: The dataset used in this project includes the number of study hours and the corresponding percentage scores of students.
Data Visualization: A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between study hours and percentage scores.
Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
Model Creation: A linear regression model is created and trained on the training data.
Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Prediction: The model is used to predict the percentage score for a given number of study hours.
Visualization: The regression line is visualized along with the actual data points to understand the fit of the model.
Key Features
Simple Linear Regression: The project employs a simple linear regression model, which is easy to understand and implement.
Data Visualization: Provides clear visualizations of the data and the regression line.
